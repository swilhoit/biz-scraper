The ledger books benefit a wide variety of users, from individuals who need to manage their personal or business finances better to students learning about financial management to professionals in accounting or bookkeeping who want to manage their clients in a tangible format. With this business, a buyer is presented with the opportunity to take over a simple Amazon FBA business with strong margins and reviews and scale it to a much larger size through expanded product lines and variations. The products are sold hundreds of times each month and have an average rating of 4.6 out of five stars on Amazon. Tariffs are a looming concern for many buyers looking to acquire businesses that import. The sellers pulled forward 6–7 months of inventory in anticipation of new tariffs. This will protect the business and margins until the fall of 2025. Also, the sellers have negotiated with the supplier, who has agreed to bear much of the burden of the increased tariff costs. Their cost of goods sold averages 18.6% for this brand. With strong gross margins and a supplier that is willing to bear some cost, this brand is in an excellent position to navigate the current market environment. In addition, the factory gives the sellers incredible terms on orders: they pay net 60 with zero deposit. The sellers boast an impressive ROAS of 3.92x so far in 2025. Their approach is to build brands that perform consistently and organically for most of the sales. Because of that goal, they have not exhausted the paid spend opportunity. Across their portfolio of businesses, they spend 1% of revenue on paid campaigns. A new owner could—and maybe should—decide to spend more if they want to grow the paid acquisition side of the business. The sellers spend no more than 1 hour per week operating the business. The sellers enjoy the start-up phase and like to sell when it’s time to scale.

The business initially sold leather journals, but the product’s paper quality attracted so much positive feedback that the owner expanded into dedicated artisanal paper products and effectively created a new market on Amazon. As a result of its first-mover advantage, the quality of the product, and effective exclusivity with its supplier, the business has garnered huge popularity and customer loyalty with more than 6,000 reviews, a 4.6-star rating, and a 17% repeat purchase rate. Having established loyalty as the go-to Journaling and Paper brand, the owner now sees significant expansion opportunities into adjacent categories, alongside supplements to existing winning products. There is also a new and growing wholesale channel, with B2B partners showing strong interest in acquiring the products at scale. Thus far, the business continues to grow well and is up 15% in Q1. Internally, the business is well-organized with a full team of remote virtual assistants managing PPC, listing optimization, operations, and customer support. Many of these have been with the business for several years, allowing the owner to dedicate time to business development and growth. A bookkeeper and data analyst also provide ancillary support. The reason for the sale is to facilitate early retirement and allow the owner to dedicate more time to his family after a recent health diagnosis. Please note: The business is based in Canada and is not eligible for an SBA loan; however, it is eligible for Canadian bank financing.

The business operates primarily through two sales channels—their Shopify store and Amazon—generating approximately $1.7 million in annual revenue (post Amazon/Shopify fees). Shopify brings in about $1M in revenue, while Amazon grosses about $800K. The headbands account for just under 50% of revenue and nearly 100% of Amazon revenue. Over the last two years, they have shifted to swimsuits. Each of the past two seasons, they have experienced stockouts on their best-sellers. Shopify AOV (average order value) is currently $90 but increases throughout the swim season, and customer acquisition cost (through Meta) stands at $35. The email list has 50,000 subscribers, and the brand has 10,000 SMS subscribers. Most marketing is focused on Meta advertising and influencers. The company has 98K followers on Instagram and 29K on Facebook. Growth opportunities include listing the full product line on Amazon, wholesale expansion, custom co-branded headbands, and correct inventory forecasting (they’ve run out of best-sellers each swim season). The owners have operated the business as a lifestyle business for years while spending a combined 15–20 hours weekly managing all aspects of the business. As a lean, efficiently operated business with minimal overhead, this company presents an opportunity for an entrepreneurial buyer to acquire a stable brand with established systems and significant growth potential.

SBA is not an option for this listing. We are in search of cash buyers. The seller is happy to utilize an asset sale for this transaction. This 7-year-old ladies’ bag business sells exclusively through Amazon FBA in the UK. The business has been a steady performer for many years. This business sells clutch bags, wedding clutch bags, evening clutch bags, and leather bags predominantly targeted to ladies of all ages. With this business, a buyer is presented with the opportunity to acquire a steady and thriving ladies’ bag business and expand into the US where the retail market is 10 times larger than the UK market. The business sources all stock from China and the United Kingdom. The existing business is unaffected by the current tariff concerns as they are sourcing to the UK. When expanding to the US, tariffs will likely be part of the equation, but the good news is that the margins are extremely healthy. At just over 30%, the business could navigate tariffs well. The business is extremely well diversified. The seller has about 1,500 SKUs. She orders twice per week and carries minimal inventory. On average, she carries about US$50,000 in inventory and will peak at around US$90,000 in the summer. A new owner could utilize a larger warehouse and expand bag offerings as well as inventory. She has found a very efficient formula for running the business out of a small space. The seller works between 15 and 30 hours each week depending on the time of year. She believes that a buyer with more time or a team could make a huge difference in growing the business. She is not utilizing any paid promotion for the business. It is rare to find a successful Amazon business that is not utilizing Amazon’s PPC. The seller is turning 48 this year and wants to spend more time with her children. She would like to sell the business to free up time for her family.

While growth has been constrained by the founder’s limited time and focus, the business has clear paths to accelerated growth through immediate COGS (cost of goods sold) reductions, elimination of over $40K in preventable fees, optimized inventory management, and geographic expansion into ready markets. This Amazon-based business operates mainly across Amazon US but also Amazon UK and Amazon Germany. Revenue generation follows a predictable seasonal pattern with 60% of annual sales concentrated in the fourth quarter, creating a highly profitable cash generation cycle that allows for strategic inventory planning and working capital management. This seasonality demonstrates the business’s strength in capturing holiday gift-giving demand while maintaining consistent profitability throughout the year across all operating markets. The business benefits from dominant Amazon organic rankings for the best keyword by volume, with over 83% of sales from organic traffic rather than paid advertising. An experienced support team, including a virtual assistant, an operations manager, and administrative support, has committed to continuing under new ownership. This acquisition opportunity represents a combination of established market position, proven profitability, clear growth catalysts, and operational improvements that can be implemented immediately to enhance returns. The business does not qualify for SBA financing (no US-based tax returns), and the lower multiple is a result of the fact that we are seeking cash offers and a quick close.
